Although health data interoperability standards include Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) have been developed and promoted, it is impossible for all the different categories of services to adopt in the near future. The objective of this study aims to apply Semantic Web technologies to integrate the health data from heterogeneously built services. We present an Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based ontology that models together health data from FHIR standard implemented services, normal Web services and Linked Data. It works on the resource integration layer of the presented layered integration architecture. An example use case that demonstrates how this method integrates the health data into a linked semantic health resource graph with the proposed ontology is presented.","tags":["FHIR","Health data integration","REST","Semantic Web","Web service","eHealth","ontology"],"title":"An Ontological Approach to Integrate Health Resources from Different Categories of Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cong Peng","Prashant Goswami","Guohua Bai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514761200,"objectID":"2979f299debfb142891b565c7962abe8","permalink":"https://pcx.linkedinfo.co/publication/pcx-2018-c/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcx-2018-c/","section":"publication","summary":"The vast amount of Web services brings the problem of discovering desired services for composition and orchestration. The syntactic service matching methods based on the classical set theory have a difficulty to capture the imprecise information. Therefore, an approximate service matching approach based on fuzzy control is explored in this paper. A service description matching model to the OpenAPI specification, which is the most widely used standard for describing the defacto REST Web services, is proposed to realize the fuzzy service matching with the fuzzy inference method developed by Mamdani and Assilian. An evaluation shows that the fuzzy service matching approach performed slightly better than the weighted approach in the setting context.","tags":null,"title":"Fuzzy Matching of OpenAPI Described REST Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cong Peng","Prashant Goswami","Guohua Bai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514761200,"objectID":"07ecb044ca58895dc86215b3dd2d5afb","permalink":"https://pcx.linkedinfo.co/publication/pcx-2018-b/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcx-2018-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Various health Web services host a huge amount of health data about patients. The heterogeneity of the services hinders the collaborative utilization of these health data, which can provide a valuable support for the self-management of chronic diseases. The combination of REST Web services and Semantic Web technologies has proven to be a viable approach to address the problem. This paper proposes a method to add semantic annotations to the REST Web services. The service descriptions and the resource representations with semantic annotations can be transformed into a resource graph. It integrates health data from different services, and can link to the health-domain ontologies and Linked Open Health Data to support health management and imaginative applications. The feasibility of our method is demonstrated by realizing with OpenAPI service description and JSON-LD representation in an example use case.","tags":null,"title":"Linking Health Web Services as Resource Graph by Semantic REST Resource Tagging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cong Peng","Guohua Bai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514761200,"objectID":"bd953f4e0ce85f1fbf6d4b9aa345c53d","permalink":"https://pcx.linkedinfo.co/publication/pcx-2018-a/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcx-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The utilization of Web services is becoming a human labor consuming work as the rapid growth of Web. The semantic annotated service description can support more automatic ways on tasks such as service discovery, invocation and composition. But the adoption of existed Semantic Web Services solutions is hindering by their overly complexity and high expertise demand. In this paper we propose a highly lightweight and non-intrusive method to enrich the REST Web service resources with semantic annotations to support a more autonomous Web service utilization and generic client service interaction. It is achieved by turning the service description into a semantic resource graph represented in RDF, with the added tag based semantic annotation and a small vocabulary. The method is implemented with the popular OpenAPI service description format, and illustrated by a simple use case example.","tags":["OpenAPI","REST","Semantic Annotation","Semantic Web Services","Service Discovery","Web Service Description"],"title":"Using Tag based Semantic Annotation to Empower Client and REST Service Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cong Peng","Guohua Bai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"31e3a3b71b5ab915c6d140c2e759a6b2","permalink":"https://pcx.linkedinfo.co/publication/pcx-2016/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcx-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Health data sharing can benefit patients to self-manage the challenging chronic diseases out of hospital. The patient controlled electronic Personal Health Record (PHR), as a tool manages comprehensive health data, is absolutely a good entry point to share health data with multiple parties for mutual benefits in the long-term. However, sharing health data from PHR remains challenges. The sharing of health data has to be considered holistically together with the key issues such as privacy, compatibility, evolvement and so on. A PHR system should be flexible to aggregate health data of a patient from various sources to make it comprehensive and up-to-date, should be flexible to share different categories and levels of health data for various utilizations and should be flexible to embed emerging access control mechanisms to ensure privacy and security under different sceneries. Therefore, the flexibility of system architecture on the integration of existed and future diversifications is crucial for PHR's practical long-term usability. This paper discussed the necessity and some possible solution, based on the reviewed literatures and the experience from a previous study, of flexible PHR system architecture on the mentioned aspects.","tags":null,"title":"Flexible System Architecture of PHR to Support Sharing Health Data for Chronic Disease Self-Management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.
