The syntactic service matching methods based on the classical set theory have a difficulty to capture the imprecise information. Therefore, an approximate service matching approach based on fuzzy control is explored in this paper. A service description matching model to the OpenAPI specification, which is the most widely used standard for describing the defacto REST Web services, is proposed to realize the fuzzy service matching with the fuzzy inference method developed by Mamdani and Assilian. An evaluation shows that the fuzzy service matching approach performed slightly better than the weighted approach in the setting context.","tags":null,"title":"Fuzzy Matching of OpenAPI Described REST Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cong Peng","Prashant Goswami","Guohua Bai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514761200,"objectID":"07ecb044ca58895dc86215b3dd2d5afb","permalink":"/publication/pcx-2018-b/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcx-2018-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Various health Web services host a huge amount of health data about patients. The heterogeneity of the services hinders the collaborative utilization of these health data, which can provide a valuable support for the self-management of chronic diseases. The combination of REST Web services and Semantic Web technologies has proven to be a viable approach to address the problem. This paper proposes a method to add semantic annotations to the REST Web services. The service descriptions and the resource representations with semantic annotations can be transformed into a resource graph. It integrates health data from different services, and can link to the health-domain ontologies and Linked Open Health Data to support health management and imaginative applications. The feasibility of our method is demonstrated by realizing with OpenAPI service description and JSON-LD representation in an example use case.","tags":null,"title":"Linking Health Web Services as Resource Graph by Semantic REST Resource Tagging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cong Peng","Guohua Bai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514761200,"objectID":"bd953f4e0ce85f1fbf6d4b9aa345c53d","permalink":"/publication/pcx-2018-a/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcx-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Using Tag based Semantic Annotation to Empower Client and REST Service Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cong Peng","Guohua Bai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"31e3a3b71b5ab915c6d140c2e759a6b2","permalink":"/publication/pcx-2016/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcx-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Flexible System Architecture of PHR to Support Sharing Health Data for Chronic Disease Self-Management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

Sharing health information could improve the quality of patient self-management. In this paper, we introduce cloud computing as a potential technology to provide a more sustainable long-term solution compared with other technologies. A hybrid cloud is identified as a suitable way to enable patients to share health information for promoting the treatment of chronic diseases. And then a prototype on the case of type 2 diabetes is implemented to prove the feasibility of the proposed solution.","tags":["Hybrid cloud","[Chronic disease","cloud computing","i"],"title":"Sharing health data through hybrid cloud for self-management","type":"publication"}]
