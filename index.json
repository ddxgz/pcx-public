It also makes health self-management much more feasible, which can partially mitigate one of the challenges that the current healthcare system is facing. Effective and convenient self-management of health requires the collaborative use of health data and home environment data from different services, devices, and even open data on the Web. Although health data interoperability standards including HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and IoT ontology including Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) have been developed and promoted, it is impossible for all the different categories of services to adopt the same standard in the near future. This study presents a method that applies Semantic Web technologies to integrate the health data and home environment data from heterogeneously built services and devices. We propose a Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based integration ontology that models health data from HL7 FHIR standard implemented services, normal Web services and Web of Things (WoT) services and Linked Data together with home environment data from formal ontology-described WoT services. It works on the resource integration layer of the layered integration architecture. An example use case with a prototype implementation shows that the proposed method successfully integrates the health data and home environment data into a resource graph. The integrated data are annotated with semantics and ontological links, which make them machine-understandable and cross-system reusable.","tags":["FHIR","REST","Semantic Web","Web service","WoT","eHealth","health data integration","ontology","smart homes"],"title":"Meaningful Integration of Data from Heterogeneous Health Services and Home Environment Based on Ontology","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Web should be an open web.

However, although a plenty of studies have been performed, there are still various factors that will affect students' group work-based learning in practice. It is important for the teachers to understand which factors are influenceable and what can be done to influence. This paper performs a literature review to identify the factors that has been investigated and reported in journal articles. Fifteen journal articles were found relevant and fifteen factors were identified, which could be influenced by instructors directly or indirectly. However, more evidence is needed to support the conclusion of some studies since they were performed only in one single course. Therefore, more studies are required on this topic to investigate the factors in different subject areas.","tags":["Group work","TBL","collaborative learning","teamwork"],"title":"What Can Teachers Do to Make the Group Work Learning Effective - a Literature Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cong Peng","Prashant Goswami","Guohua Bai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538344800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538344800,"objectID":"9706bb40671e2c103cc24202b650b5b7","permalink":"https://pcx.linkedinfo.co/publication/pcx-2018-d/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcx-2018-d/","section":"publication","summary":"Effective and convenient self-management of health requires collaborative utilization of health data from different services provided by healthcare providers, consumer-facing products and even open data on the Web.

The syntactic service matching methods based on the classical set theory have a difficulty to capture the imprecise information. Therefore, an approximate service matching approach based on fuzzy control is explored in this paper. A service description matching model to the OpenAPI specification, which is the most widely used standard for describing the defacto REST Web services, is proposed to realize the fuzzy service matching with the fuzzy inference method developed by Mamdani and Assilian. An evaluation shows that the fuzzy service matching approach performed slightly better than the weighted approach in the setting context.","tags":null,"title":"Fuzzy Matching of OpenAPI Described REST Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cong Peng","Prashant Goswami","Guohua Bai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514761200,"objectID":"07ecb044ca58895dc86215b3dd2d5afb","permalink":"https://pcx.linkedinfo.co/publication/pcx-2018-b/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcx-2018-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Various health Web services host a huge amount of health data about patients. The heterogeneity of the services hinders the collaborative utilization of these health data, which can provide a valuable support for the self-management of chronic diseases.

This paper proposes a method to add semantic annotations to the REST Web services. The service descriptions and the resource representations with semantic annotations can be transformed into a resource graph. It integrates health data from different services, and can link to the health-domain ontologies and Linked Open Health Data to support health management and imaginative applications.

The semantic annotated service description can support more automatic ways on tasks such as service discovery, invocation and composition. But the adoption of existed Semantic Web Services solutions is hindering by their overly complexity and high expertise demand. In this paper we propose a highly lightweight and non-intrusive method to enrich the REST Web service resources with semantic annotations to support a more autonomous Web service utilization and generic client service interaction. It is achieved by turning the service description into a semantic resource graph represented in RDF, with the added tag based semantic annotation and a small vocabulary. The method is implemented with the popular OpenAPI service description format, and illustrated by a simple use case example.","tags":["OpenAPI","REST","Semantic Annotation","Semantic Web Services","Service Discovery","Web Service Description"],"title":"Using Tag based Semantic Annotation to Empower Client and REST Service Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"e368e80244db4f7a9c74bc3236074d9e","permalink":"https://pcx.linkedinfo.co/post/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Posts","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Cong Peng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"bf2e6fb9722806fbbc16597bcfe691f8","permalink":"https://pcx.linkedinfo.co/publication/peng-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/peng-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Record keeping","research ethics"],"title":"Good Record Keeping for Conducting Research Ethically Correct","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cong Peng","Guohua Bai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"31e3a3b71b5ab915c6d140c2e759a6b2","permalink":"https://pcx.linkedinfo.co/publication/pcx-2016/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcx-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Health data sharing can benefit patients to self-manage the challenging chronic diseases out of hospital. The patient controlled electronic Personal Health Record (PHR), as a tool manages comprehensive health data, is absolutely a good entry point to share health data with multiple parties for mutual benefits in the long-term. However, sharing health data from PHR remains challenges. The sharing of health data has to be considered holistically together with the key issues such as privacy, compatibility, evolvement and so on. A PHR system should be flexible to aggregate health data of a patient from various sources to make it comprehensive and up-to-date, should be flexible to share different categories and levels of health data for various utilizations and should be flexible to embed emerging access control mechanisms to ensure privacy and security under different sceneries. Therefore, the flexibility of system architecture on the integration of existed and future diversifications is crucial for PHR's practical long-term usability. This paper discussed the necessity and some possible solution, based on the reviewed literatures and the experience from a previous study, of flexible PHR system architecture on the mentioned aspects.","tags":null,"title":"Flexible System Architecture of PHR to Support Sharing Health Data for Chronic Disease Self-Management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.
