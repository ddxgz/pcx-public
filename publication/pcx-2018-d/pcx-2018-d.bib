 abstract = {Effective and convenient self-management of health requires collaborative utilization of health data from different services provided by healthcare providers, consumer-facing products and even open data on the Web. Although health data interoperability standards include Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) have been developed and promoted, it is impossible for all the different categories of services to adopt in the near future. The objective of this study aims to apply Semantic Web technologies to integrate the health data from heterogeneously built services. We present an Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based ontology that models together health data from FHIR standard implemented services, normal Web services and Linked Data. It works on the resource integration layer of the presented layered integration architecture. An example use case that demonstrates how this method integrates the health data into a linked semantic health resource graph with the proposed ontology is presented.},
